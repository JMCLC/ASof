Design a Notification Service:
- Purpose of Design:
  - Notification System
  - Highly available and scalable
  - Soft real-time
- Primary Functionalities:
  - Send Notifications
  - Gathering Information
- Constraints:
  - Use a set of Third Party Services
- Qualities:
  - Availability: Notification System crashes and notifications are delivered at least once
  - Modifiability:
    - Add a new third party service in design time takes 1 month and is fully operational without introducing bugs in existing code
    - Increase in the number of notifications sends and the performance is preserved
    - Increase in the number of users is automatically supported
  - Security:
    - Unidentified client tries to send a notification but the notification is sent and the service is not disrupted
    - DDOS Attack
    - Impersonate
  - Performance:
    - Client App sends notification and it is received in latency 95% in < 1s, 3% in 1s < 3s, 1% in 3s < 1m, 1% > 1m
- Rounds:
  - Round 1:
    - Purpose of design: The architecture for a fully operational system without scalability and availability
    - Iteration 1:
      - Primary Functionalities
      - Add new Third Party
    - Iteration 2:
      - Performance
    - Iteration 3:
      - Security
  - Round 2:
    - Purpose of design: Add Scalability
    - Iteration 1:
      - Increase notification
    - Iteration 2:
      - Increase users
